# Multi-Shot Prompting in CivicsCoach

## What is Multi-Shot Prompting?

Multi-shot prompting is an advanced AI prompting technique that provides multiple examples to guide the AI model's responses. Unlike zero-shot prompting (which gives no examples) or single-shot prompting (which gives one example), multi-shot prompting provides several examples to establish patterns, improve consistency, and enhance response quality.

### Key Concepts

1. **Few-Shot Learning**: The AI model learns from multiple examples to understand the expected output format and quality
2. **Pattern Establishment**: Examples help establish consistent patterns for complex tasks
3. **Quality Improvement**: Multiple examples reduce ambiguity and improve response consistency
4. **Demonstration-Based Learning**: The AI learns through examples rather than just instructions

## How Multi-Shot Prompting Works

### 1. Example Selection
The system selects appropriate examples based on:
- **Task Type**: Different examples for debate, analysis, comparison, and explanation
- **User Proficiency**: Examples are matched to user's skill level (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)
- **Complexity Matching**: Examples are selected to match the user's expected comprehension level

### 2. Prompt Structure
Each multi-shot prompt includes:
- **System Message**: Defines the AI's role and capabilities
- **Task Instructions**: Clear description of what needs to be done
- **Multiple Examples**: 2-3 examples showing the expected output format
- **Output Requirements**: Detailed specifications for the response format
- **Context Information**: Retrieved chunks and additional context

### 3. Example Integration
Examples are carefully formatted and integrated into the prompt:
```
EXAMPLE 1:
Topic: Separation of Powers in Indian Constitution
Proficiency: Intermediate
Output:
{
  "stance": "The Indian Constitution establishes...",
  "counterStance": "While the Constitution establishes...",
  ...
}

EXAMPLE 2:
Topic: Fundamental Rights vs Directive Principles
Proficiency: Advanced
Output:
{
  ...
}
```

## Implementation in CivicsCoach

### Core Components

  };
  
  // Select examples that match or are below user's proficiency level
  const suitableExamples = examples.filter(example => 
    example.proficiency.toLowerCase() === proficiency.toLowerCase() ||
    proficiencyLevels[example.proficiency.toLowerCase()] <= complexity
  );
  
  return selectedExamples.slice(0, requiredCount);
