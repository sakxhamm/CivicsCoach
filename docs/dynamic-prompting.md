# Dynamic Prompting in CivicsCoach

## Overview

Dynamic prompting is an advanced AI technique that automatically adapts and optimizes prompts based on multiple contextual factors. Instead of using static, one-size-fits-all prompts, the system analyzes inputs in real-time and constructs the most effective prompt for each specific situation.

## What is Dynamic Prompting?

Dynamic prompting is like having an intelligent teacher who automatically adjusts their teaching style based on:
- The student's current knowledge level
- The complexity of the topic being discussed
- The type of question being asked
- Previous interactions and learning patterns

## Key Benefits

1. **Adaptive Complexity**: Automatically adjusts response complexity based on user proficiency
2. **Context-Aware Examples**: Selects relevant examples based on query complexity and user level
3. **Real-time Optimization**: Continuously improves prompts based on what works best
4. **Efficiency**: No manual prompt engineering needed for different scenarios
5. **Better User Experience**: Users get responses that match their understanding level

## How It Works

### 1. Complexity Analysis
The system automatically analyzes each query to determine its complexity level:

```javascript
const complexity = {
  level: 'medium', // simple, medium, complex
  factors: ['legal_terms:2', 'analytical_question'],
  score: 4
};
```

**Complexity Factors:**
- Query length and structure
- Presence of legal/constitutional terminology
- Question type (factual vs. analytical)
- Overall complexity score

### 2. Context Building
Based on complexity analysis and user proficiency, the system builds contextual information:

```javascript
const context = {
  examples: selectedExamples,
  reasoningDepth: 'detailed', // minimal, basic, detailed, comprehensive, exhaustive
  outputFormat: 'standard', // simplified, standard, academic
  additionalInstructions: ['Use simple language', 'Provide examples']
};
```

### 3. Prompt Optimization
The system optimizes the final prompt by:
- Adding context-specific modifications
- Including relevant examples
- Adjusting language complexity
- Modifying output format instructions

## Implementation Architecture

### Core Components

#### DynamicPromptEngine
Main orchestrator that coordinates all dynamic prompting functionality.

#### ComplexityAnalyzer
Analyzes query characteristics to determine appropriate complexity level.

#### ContextBuilder
Builds contextual information based on complexity and user preferences.

#### PromptOptimizer
Optimizes prompts based on context and previous interactions.

### Code Structure

```javascript
class DynamicPromptEngine {
  constructor() {
    this.complexityAnalyzer = this.createComplexityAnalyzer();
    this.contextBuilder = this.createContextBuilder();
    this.promptOptimizer = this.createPromptOptimizer();
  }

  generateDynamicPrompt(query, proficiency, retrievedChunks, options) {
    const complexity = this.complexityAnalyzer.analyze(query);
    const context = this.contextBuilder.buildContext(query, proficiency, complexity, retrievedChunks);
    const basePrompt = this.createBasePrompt(query, proficiency, retrievedChunks, complexity);
    const optimizedPrompt = this.promptOptimizer.optimizePrompt(basePrompt, context, options.previousResponses);
    
    return { messages, metadata: { complexity, context } };
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Simple Query for Beginner
**Input:** "What is the Constitution?"
**Complexity:** Simple
**Output:** Simplified language, basic examples, bullet-point format

### Complex Query for Advanced User
**Input:** "Analyze the evolution of federalism in India post-independence and its implications for contemporary governance"
**Complexity:** Complex
**Output:** Academic language, advanced examples, comprehensive analysis format

## Integration with Existing System

### Backend Integration
The dynamic prompting system is seamlessly integrated with the existing debate generation:

```javascript
// In debateController.js
if (req.body.useDynamicPrompting !== false) {
  const dynamicPrompt = dynamicPromptEngine.generateDynamicPrompt(
    query, proficiency, retrievedChunks, options
  );
  messages = dynamicPrompt.messages;
  dynamicMetadata = dynamicPrompt.metadata;
} else {
  // Fallback to traditional prompting
  messages = buildChainMessages({...});
}
```

### Frontend Controls
Users can enable/disable dynamic prompting:

```jsx
<div className="form-group checkbox-group">
  <label className="checkbox-label">
    <input
      type="checkbox"
      checked={useDynamicPrompting}
      onChange={(e) => setUseDynamicPrompting(e.target.checked)}
    />
    <span className="checkmark"></span>
    Enable Dynamic Prompting
  </label>
  <small className="help-text">
    Dynamic prompting adapts prompts based on query complexity and user proficiency
  </small>
</div>
```

## Configuration Options

### Complexity Levels
- **Simple**: Basic queries, simple language, minimal reasoning
- **Medium**: Standard queries, balanced complexity, detailed reasoning
- **Complex**: Advanced queries, academic language, comprehensive reasoning

### Proficiency Levels
- **Beginner**: Simplified language, concrete examples, basic concepts
- **Intermediate**: Standard language, balanced examples, detailed concepts
- **Advanced**: Academic language, nuanced examples, comprehensive analysis

### Output Formats
- **Simplified**: Bullet points, simple language, basic structure
- **Standard**: Balanced format, moderate complexity, standard structure
- **Academic**: Formal format, advanced complexity, comprehensive structure

## Performance Metrics

The system tracks various metrics for continuous improvement:

```javascript
metadata: {
  dynamicPrompting: true,
  dynamicMetadata: {
    complexity: { level: 'medium', score: 4, factors: [...] },
    context: { reasoningDepth: 'detailed', outputFormat: 'standard' },
    promptLength: 1250,
    dynamicFeatures: ['examples', 'reasoningDepth', 'outputFormat', 'additionalInstructions']
  }
}
```

## Fallback Behavior

When dynamic prompting is disabled or encounters issues, the system gracefully falls back to traditional prompting:

```javascript
// Fallback to original chain-of-thought prompt
messages = buildChainMessages({ 
  audience: proficiency, 
  topic: query, 
  retrievedChunks, 
  minCitations: 2, 
  proficiency, 
  examples: true 
});
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Machine Learning Integration**: Using response quality feedback to improve prompt optimization
2. **User Behavior Analysis**: Learning from how users interact with different response types
3. **Multi-modal Adaptation**: Adapting not just text but also visual and interactive elements
4. **Real-time Learning**: Continuous improvement based on user feedback and success metrics

## Best Practices

1. **Always provide fallback options** for when dynamic prompting is disabled
2. **Track performance metrics** to continuously improve the system
3. **Maintain backward compatibility** with existing prompt systems
4. **Use clear complexity indicators** to help users understand system behavior
5. **Implement graceful degradation** for edge cases and errors

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Complexity Detection Errors**
   - Check query preprocessing and analysis logic
   - Verify legal terminology detection patterns
   - Review complexity scoring algorithms

2. **Context Building Failures**
   - Ensure examples database is properly populated
   - Check proficiency level mapping
   - Verify context builder logic

3. **Prompt Optimization Issues**
   - Review prompt template structure
   - Check instruction generation logic
   - Verify example integration

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging to troubleshoot issues:

```javascript
// Add debug logging
console.log('Dynamic Prompt Debug:', {
  query,
  complexity,
  context,
  finalPrompt: optimizedPrompt
});
```

## Conclusion

Dynamic prompting represents a significant evolution in how we interact with AI systems. By automatically adapting to user needs and query complexity, it provides a more personalized and effective learning experience.

The implementation in CivicsCoach demonstrates how this technique can be applied to educational AI systems, making them more intelligent and user-friendly while maintaining the flexibility to serve diverse user types and use cases.
