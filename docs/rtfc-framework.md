# RTFC Framework in CivicsCoach

## Overview

The RTFC Framework is a comprehensive prompting methodology that ensures clear, structured, and effective AI interactions. This framework is specifically designed for the CivicsCoach project to generate high-quality, consistent responses for constitutional education.

## What is the RTFC Framework?

The RTFC Framework is an acronym that represents five essential components of effective AI prompting:

- **R** - **ROLE**: Defines the AI's identity and capabilities
- **T** - **TASK**: Specifies what needs to be accomplished
- **F** - **FORMAT**: Defines the expected output structure
- **C** - **CONTEXT**: Provides relevant background and information
- **C** - **CONSTRAINTS**: Sets boundaries and requirements

## Framework Components

### 1. ROLE (R)

The ROLE component establishes the AI's identity, expertise, and capabilities.

#### Purpose
- Defines who the AI is in the conversation
- Establishes credibility and authority
- Sets expectations for response quality and style
- Ensures consistent personality across interactions

#### Implementation in CivicsCoach
```javascript
civicsCoach: {
  identity: "CivicsCoach",
  expertise: "Indian Constitutional Law and Political Science",
  qualifications: [
    "Expert knowledge of constitutional principles and legal doctrines",
    "Deep understanding of Indian political systems and governance",
    "Experience in constitutional analysis and legal interpretation",
    "Proficiency in political science and democratic theory"
  ],
  capabilities: [
    "Analyze constitutional concepts with precision and clarity",
    "Generate balanced debates with evidence-based arguments",
    "Explain complex legal concepts in accessible language",
    "Compare constitutional doctrines and their implications"
  ],
  personality: [
    "Professional and authoritative yet approachable",
    "Balanced and objective in analysis",
    "Educational and informative in approach",
    "Respectful of constitutional principles and democratic values"
  ]
}
```

#### Benefits
- **Consistency**: AI maintains the same identity across all interactions
- **Credibility**: Users trust responses from a clearly defined expert
- **Personality**: Responses reflect the intended tone and approach
- **Specialization**: AI focuses on constitutional law expertise

### 2. TASK (T)

The TASK component clearly defines what the AI needs to accomplish.

#### Purpose
- Specifies the exact objective to be achieved
- Outlines requirements and expectations
- Sets complexity levels and scope
- Defines expected outcomes

#### Implementation in CivicsCoach
```javascript
debate: {
  name: "Structured Constitutional Debate Generation",
  objective: "Create a balanced, evidence-based debate on constitutional topics",
  requirements: [
    "Generate opposing viewpoints with equal weight",
    "Support arguments with constitutional citations",
    "Create educational quiz questions",
    "Provide key takeaways for learning"
  ],
  complexity: "High - requires balanced analysis and evidence synthesis",
  expectedOutcome: "Comprehensive debate structure ready for educational use"
}
```

#### Benefits
- **Clarity**: AI understands exactly what is expected
- **Focus**: Responses stay on track and address the core objective
- **Quality**: Requirements ensure comprehensive coverage
- **Measurability**: Success can be evaluated against clear criteria

### 3. FORMAT (F)

The FORMAT component defines the structure and organization of the expected output.

#### Purpose
- Specifies the exact output structure required
- Defines field types, descriptions, and requirements
- Ensures consistent data format for UI rendering
- Provides validation criteria

#### Implementation in CivicsCoach
```javascript
debate: {
  structure: "JSON object with specific fields",
  fields: {
    stance: {
      type: "string",
      maxLength: 150,
      description: "Main argument supporting the topic",
      requirements: "Clear, logical, evidence-based"
    },
    counterStance: {
      type: "string",
      maxLength: 150,
      description: "Opposing viewpoint or counter-argument",
      requirements: "Balanced, reasonable, well-argued"
    },
    citations: {
      type: "array",
      structure: {
        id: "unique_identifier",
        source: "source_name",
        snippet: "relevant_text_excerpt",
        relevance: "explanation_of_relevance"
      },
      requirements: "Must support arguments, properly formatted"
    }
  },
  validation: "Must be valid JSON with all required fields"
}
```

#### Benefits
- **Consistency**: All responses follow the same structure
- **UI Compatibility**: Predictable format for frontend rendering
- **Validation**: Easy to verify response completeness
- **Scalability**: Same structure works across different topics

### 4. CONTEXT (C)

The CONTEXT component provides relevant background information and audience context.

#### Purpose
- Sets the stage for the AI's response
- Defines the target audience and their needs
- Provides relevant background information
- Establishes learning objectives

#### Implementation in CivicsCoach
```javascript
constitutionalEducation: {
  audience: "Students and learners of constitutional law",
  background: "Indian constitutional framework and democratic principles",
  objectives: [
    "Understanding constitutional concepts",
    "Learning democratic governance",
    "Developing civic awareness",
    "Building analytical skills"
  ],
  constraints: [
    "Must be accurate and legally sound",
    "Should be accessible to target proficiency level",
    "Must promote democratic values",
    "Should encourage critical thinking"
  ]
}
```

#### Benefits
- **Relevance**: Responses are tailored to the specific context
- **Audience Awareness**: Content matches user proficiency levels
- **Learning Focus**: Responses support educational objectives
- **Background Integration**: Constitutional chunks provide source material

### 5. CONSTRAINTS (C)

The CONSTRAINTS component sets boundaries and quality requirements.

#### Purpose
- Defines what the AI can and cannot do
- Sets quality standards and requirements
- Establishes ethical and legal boundaries
- Ensures compliance with educational standards

#### Implementation in CivicsCoach
```javascript
legalAccuracy: {
  category: "Legal and Constitutional",
  requirements: [
    "All constitutional references must be accurate",
    "Legal interpretations must be sound",
    "Supreme Court judgments must be correctly cited",
    "Constitutional provisions must be accurately quoted"
  ],
  limitations: [
    "Cannot provide legal advice",
    "Cannot predict court decisions",
    "Cannot interpret laws beyond constitutional context",
    "Must acknowledge areas of legal uncertainty"
  ]
}
```

#### Benefits
- **Quality Control**: Ensures high standards are maintained
- **Legal Compliance**: Prevents inappropriate legal advice
- **Ethical Boundaries**: Maintains professional standards
- **Risk Mitigation**: Reduces potential for harmful responses

## How RTFC Works in Practice

### 1. Prompt Generation Process

```javascript
// Generate RTFC prompt
const prompt = engine.generateRTFCPrompt('debate', {
  topic: "Should the President have veto power over constitutional amendments?",
  proficiency: 'intermediate',
  retrievedChunks: constitutionalChunks,
  context: 'constitutionalEducation'
});

// The system automatically builds:
// - System Message: Contains ROLE definition
// - User Message: Contains TASK, FORMAT, CONTEXT, and CONSTRAINTS
```

### 2. Prompt Structure

```
SYSTEM MESSAGE (ROLE):
